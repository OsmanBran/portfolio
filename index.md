Hi there! my name is Osman and I'm a final year computer science / finance student at QUT.
I currently work as a full-stack software developer in Brisbane. 
I am particularly interested in opportunities to apply both my programming and finance skills.
Some of my hobbies include playing piano, chess and bouldering.
